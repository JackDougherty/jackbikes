For Father's Day Weekend 2018, I biked from Hartford thru Worcester to Cambridge MA to meet up with my family and visit my son Eli. This was a short 2-day, 120-mile trip that I've wanted to do for years, instead of driving. See the [full-screen map](https://jackdougherty.github.io/bikemapcode/#8/42.276/-71.948) or the embedded version below.
