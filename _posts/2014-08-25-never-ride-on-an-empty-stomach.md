Today marks my first full ride, and I&#8217;m aiming for 60+ miles up Whidbey Island with my fully-loaded bike. Thanks to my sister Ellen for hosting me in her home last night, just north of Seattle. Her husband Rob kindly cooked us a fabulous salmon dinner last night, and a delicious egg and cheese sandwich, which I enjoyed much more than the food on my ferry. But all of this good chow reminds me of one of the many reasons why I&#8217;m riding my bike for three weeks: I&#8217;m trying to lose weight. My pre-trip weigh-in on Ellen&#8217;s scale is 178.2 pounds. Stay tuned for the post-trip weight, as my track record isn&#8217;t great in this department. Bike riding usually makes me very hungry.<figure id="attachment_25" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-25" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignright">
