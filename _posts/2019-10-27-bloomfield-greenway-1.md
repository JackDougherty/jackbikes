This weekend I pedaled along the almost-finished first section of the Bloomfield Greenway Multi-Use Trail. The path runs nearly 2 miles from Day Hill Road (on the Windsor town line), across Duncaster Road, past St. Andrews Church, to CT Route 189 near Tariffville (and this last piece is not yet paved). When completed, cyclists can bypass the CT Route 187 & 189 interchange, one of those overbuilt highways designed solely for cars, making it unsafe for bikes, even though it does not seem to carry sufficient auto traffic to justify its construction.

The broader goal is to create a safer bike route from the Farmington Canal Heritage Trail to the City of Hartford, as part of the East Coast Greenway that stretches from Maine to Florida. According to the [Town of Bloomfield](https://www.bloomfieldct.gov/engineering/pages/bloomfield-greenway) and the [Town of Simsbury](https://www.simsbury-ct.gov/home/news/public-information-meeting-bloomfieldsimsbury-multi-use-trail), a joint project between both towns will connect the path further north in Tariffville, and the second and third sections of the Bloomfield Greenway will end at Tobey Road, on the Hartford city line, near the University of Hartford. Here's a [link to my unofficial video](https://vimeo.com/369217240), and looking forward to the official opening.
