My daughter Eva and I biked 53 miles on the [Palouse to Cascades Trail](https://www.parks.wa.gov/521/Palouse-to-Cascades-Trail) to Cle Elum, WA, then north on the [Coal Mines Trail](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/coal-mines-trail-cle-elum) to Ronald WA, to meet up with our family for the 4th of July.

Thanks Eva for suggesting this wonderful ride, and to my sister Kris for lending me her bike and dropping us off at the Cedar Falls trailhead. See details about different sections of the trail in this [2020 Washington Gravel blog post](https://washingtongravelriding.home.blog/2020/08/15/the-palouse-to-cascades-trail/).

The most amazing section was our ride through the 2.3-mile Snoqualmie Tunnel. It took us over 10 minutes to pedal through this cold dark tunnel (with our brightest bike lights), and we were surprised to cross paths with several people walking in the opposite direction with their dogs. We estimate that is a 30-minute walk in one direction, then they need to turn around and walk back again in the opposite direction.
