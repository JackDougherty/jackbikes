On the eve of the West Hartford &#8220;Center Streets&#8221; event on Sunday August 27th, organizers scrambled to correct rumors that cast members and fire-breathing dragons from the HBO fantasy television series _Game of Thrones_ would appear at this family-friendly event for cyclists, strollers, and pedestrians.

&#8220;It was an honest mistake,&#8221; explained Center Streets co-organizer Ethan Frankel to a room full of befuddled reporters from Hollywood and West Hartford media outlets. &#8220;When HBO announced that the _Game of Thrones _season finale would appear at 9 PM on Sunday August 27th, it kind of got mixed up with our Center Streets publicity, which begins at 9 AM.&#8221; When reporters questioned Frankel about the cause of AM vs. PM mixup, he asked whether anyone actually reads press releases anymore, and blamed the rumors on a fake photograph created by Otis McCowboy, an overly enthusiastic social media intern for [BikeWestHartford.org](http://bikewesthartford.org). McCowboy could not be reached for comment.

Frankel's colleagues rushed to his defense. &#8220;Technically, dragons are not cars,&#8221; explained Center Streets co-organizer and scientist Edward Pawlak, &#8220;so they would be welcome to participate in our car-free event, if they actually existed.&#8221;

But HBO executive Andy Borowitz was not amused by the mixup. &#8220;_Game of Thrones_ is not a family-friendly show,&#8221; he cautioned, &#8220;unlike this car-free event in West Hartford, Connecticut.&#8221;

Come join the fun (without dragons) at Center Streets on Sunday August 27th, 2017 from 9am to 1pm in West Hartford Center. Learn more at our [public FaceBook Event Page](https://www.facebook.com/events/1798643340165787).
