On the eve of the West Hartford Center Streets event on Sunday August 27th, organizers scrambled to correct rumors that cast members and fire-breathing dragons from the HBO fantasy television series _Game of Thrones_ would appear at this family-friendly event for cyclists, strollers, and pedestrians.

"It was an honest mistake," explained Center Streets co-organizer Ethan Frankel to a room full of befuddled reporters from Hollywood and West Hartford media outlets. "When HBO announced that the _Game of Thrones_ season finale would appear at 9 PM on Sunday August 27th, it kind of got mixed up with our Center Streets publicity, which begins at 9 AM." When reporters questioned Frankel about the cause of AM vs. PM mixup, he asked whether anyone actually reads press releases anymore, and blamed the rumors on a fake photograph created by Otis McCowboy, an overly enthusiastic social media intern for [BikeWestHartford.org](http://bikewesthartford.org). McCowboy could not be reached for comment.

Frankel's colleagues rushed to his defense. "Technically, dragons are not cars," explained Center Streets co-organizer and scientist Edward Pawlak, "so they would be welcome to participate in our car-free event, if they actually existed."

But HBO executive Andy Borowitz was not amused by the mixup. "_Game of Thrones_ is not a family-friendly show," he cautioned, "unlike this car-free event in West Hartford, Connecticut."

Come join the fun (without dragons) at Center Streets on Sunday August 27th, 2017 from 9am to 1pm in West Hartford Center. Learn more at our [public FaceBook Event Page](https://www.facebook.com/events/1798643340165787).
