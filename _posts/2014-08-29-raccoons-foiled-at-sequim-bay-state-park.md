At Sequim Bay State Park, the clever park ranger has outwitted those rascally raccoons that bothered me at another Washington State Park a couple of nights ago. He explained that it wasn't within his budget to buy fancy food lockers ($1400 each), so instead he strung wire between trees over campsites, about 8 feet above the ground, which he figured was "high enough so that kids don't play on it" but low enough so that campers like me can hang a food bag on it. Worked like a charm. No hungry midnight visitors.

If you're thinking about biking in this part of Washington State, definitely check out the [Olympic Discovery Trail](http://www.olympicdiscoverytrail.com), which runs directly through Sequim Bay State Park, right up to three very nice biker/hiker sites for travelers who arrive on their own power. While a few sections are very steep, large portions of the ODT are great for families to walk or ride bikes with children.
