Today marked the first Hartford [Slow Roll](https://www.facebook.com/events/195346720842664/) Sunday bike ride of 2016. These are informal meetups of friendly cyclists who love to explore while riding around the city. Today did a leisurely 6-mile ride and landed at the southern branch of the Park River, where the waterway tunnels under downtown Hartford. I've lived here for over fifteen years and it was my first time seeing this. Come and join us on a future ride and go places that you can't reach by car. Find out about the next Slow Roll by following the Facebook page for [BiCiCo,](https://www.facebook.com/BiCiCoHartford/) Hartford's new community-oriented bike shop.
