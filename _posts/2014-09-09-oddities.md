Here's just a few of the odd things that happened to catch my eye during my <a title="Follow my Portland-Oregon Coast loop 2014" href="http://jackbikes.org/2014/09/portland-oregon-loop-2014/" target="_blank">Northwest bike trip</a> through Oregon. Of course, there's far more out there, and I mean really &#8220;out there.&#8221; If I really tried, I could fill a whole blog with &#8220;Oddities of Oregon.&#8221; Maybe that will be my next trip. So consider this to be just an appetizer. . .<figure id="attachment_119" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-119" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
