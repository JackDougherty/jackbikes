Here's just a few of the odd things that happened to catch my eye during my [Northwest bike trip](http://jackbikes.org/2014/09/portland-oregon-loop-2014) through Oregon. Of course, there's far more out there, and I mean really &#8220;out there.&#8221; If I really tried, I could fill a whole blog with &#8220;Oddities of Oregon.&#8221; Maybe that will be my next trip. So consider this to be just an appetizer...

{% include figure image_path="images/2014/FerretAgilityTrials.jpg" caption="Spotted this sign for Ferret Agility Trials on the door of a pet store in Eugene, OR. What kind of events do they have to compete in to win medals? I'm really curious, but had to leave town before it happened." %}

{% include figure image_path="images/2014/TheShiftChurchTruck.jpg" caption="The Shift Church takes a non-conformist approach to Christianity, which sounds intriguing. And the 'Shift Happens' tagline is catchy. But what would Jesus think about those fake bullet holes?" %}

{% include figure image_path="images/2014/GammonLaunch.jpg" caption="At Anderson's Viewpoint, high above Cape Lookout State Park, there's a memorial stone to Dick Gammon, who is described as a 'pioneer hang glider pilot.' But what happened to him?" %}
