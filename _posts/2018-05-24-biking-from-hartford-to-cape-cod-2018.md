For years I've been waiting for an opportunity to bike from Hartford thru Providence RI to Cape Cod MA. I had to put off this trip several times because we usually go to the Cape to visit family members, which involves driving a vehicle with a kayak and loads of stuff. But just before Memorial Day weekend 2018 the opportunity arose and I met up with Beth and Maya in Falmouth.
