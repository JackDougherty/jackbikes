Come join us in New Britain on Sunday, September 27th, 2015, for the second installment of the Discover Connecticut Bike Tour, co-sponsored by BikeWalkCT and the New Britain Museum of American Art. This is a family-friendly event, not a race, with options for 10, 25, and 50 miles rides. The registration fee also includes brunch at the museum! I'll be riding as a marshal/mobile mechanic to help folks in case of flat tires.  [Learn more details and register for this event](http://www.bikewalkct.org/discover-ct-ride-series.html).

Check out the 10, 25, and 50 mile routes on this mobile-friendly interactive map that works on all computer and smartphone browsers. See the [full-screen view](https://jackdougherty.github.io/bikemapcode/newbritain.html), or type this shortlink into your browser: bit.ly/bikenewbrit

On Sunday, several of us tested the ride with the Bike New Britain organizers, Mark Hoffman and Bruce Miller, who have planned out routes that take us on bike lanes, wide roads, and parks around the city.
