If you're looking for a bike-friendly city, visit Montreal, Canada, which deeply impressed me during my four-day Vermont-Quebec tour. The experience pushes people like me, who live in car-centric US cities and suburbs, to reconsider what's possible when changing both the infrastructure and the culture around transportation. Check it out and see for yourself! See my journey with photos in the map below or explore and download [my route on Cycle.Travel](https://cycle.travel/map/journey/626281).

Back in [July 2023 I biked from Hartford CT to Burlington VT](https://jackbikes.org/vermont-2023/), to face some mountainous inclines as well as my fears about long-distance biking with limited vision. This time I decided to name this "The Flat Parts" tour of Vermont and Quebec! I rode Amtrak's Vermonter train line from Hartford to St. Albans VT for about $50 one-way and reserved a spot to [bring my bike on board](https://www.amtrak.com/bring-your-bicycle-onboard) for $5 extra each way. Before boarding, look for a car with a "bike-friendly" sticker to locate a compartment. On this train, you need to remove your front wheel and hang the back wheel on a hook inside a special bike compartment (which also required me to politely ask other passengers to move their luggage out of the compartment marked "Reserved for Bicycles".)  Maneuvering my wide handlebars around the inside corner was a bit challenging, and my 650B x 1.95-inch wide tire just fit inside the hook. When departing the train at St. Albans, the conductor outside the car kindly lifted up front wheel so that I could more easily walk the back of the bike down the train stairs.

When planning this trip, I decided to sleep indoors, rather than camp outside, so I begrudgingly paid a premium to reserve a hotel room overnight next to the St. Albans train station due to the lack of alternatives. I chose St. Albans because it's the end of the Vermonter train line, which put me only 75 miles away from Montreal on my first day of biking. I knew ahead of time that the Vermonter was not scheduled to arrive until 9pm (sometimes later). Due to my non-existent nighttime vision, I could not safely bike to the only campsite near St. Albans I saw on the map, more than five miles away, nor did I find any Warmshowers hosts or affordable AirBnBs ahead of time. Next time, I would look more closely at my next-best alternative: get off the train at Essex Junction, put the bike on the front of the [municipal bus to Burlington](https://ridegmt.com/2-essex-2/), to somewhat more affordable overnight accommodations. But that plan depended on the train arriving before the last bus departed around 11pm, and that there was room for my bike on the two-spot bus rack. Also, starting the trip in Burlington would have added 30+ miles on my ride to Montreal, and my 59-year-old body can no longer handle 100-mile days on the bike. So I swallowed my thrifty-spending pride and paid the premium for the St. Albans hotel room....sigh.
