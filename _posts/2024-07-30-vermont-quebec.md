If you're looking for a bike-friendly city, visit Montreal, Canada, which deeply impressed me during my four-day Vermont-Quebec tour. The experience pushes people like me, who live in car-centric US cities and suburbs, to reconsider what's possible when changing both the infrastructure and the culture around transportation. Check it out and see for yourself! See my journey with photos in the map below or explore and download [my route on Cycle.Travel](https://cycle.travel/map/journey/626281).

Back in [July 2023 I biked from Hartford CT to Burlington VT](https://jackbikes.org/vermont-2023/), to face some mountainous inclines as well as my fears about long-distance biking with limited vision. This time I decided to name this "The Flat Parts" tour of Vermont and Quebec! I rode Amtrak's Vermonter train line from Hartford to St. Albans VT for about $50 one-way and reserved a spot to [bring my bike on board](https://www.amtrak.com/bring-your-bicycle-onboard) for $5 extra each way. Before boarding, look for a car with a "bike-friendly" sticker to locate a compartment. On this train, you need to remove your front wheel and hang the back wheel on a hook inside a special bike compartment (which also required me to politely ask other passengers to move their luggage out of the compartment marked "Reserved for Bicycles".)  Maneuvering my wide handlebars around the inside corner was a bit challenging, and my 650B x 1.95-inch wide tire just fit inside the hook. When departing the train at St. Albans, the conductor outside the car kindly lifted up front wheel so that I could more easily walk the back of the bike down the train stairs.
