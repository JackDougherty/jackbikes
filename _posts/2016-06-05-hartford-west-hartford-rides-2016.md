Join the Hartford &#8220;Slow Rolls&#8221; for informal rides to explore the city and meet people on selected Sunday afternoons. The pace is usually around 10-12 miles per hour, for about an hour of actual riding, and the direction depends on whatever the group decides (which sometimes changes mid-route). This is not a highly-structured route with cue sheets, but rather a friendly ride with people who enjoy exploring. Although I've been riding around the city for fifteen years, I always learn something new, and enjoy meeting folks who come out with us. The organizers usually announce about two rides per month as Facebook events, which are usually shared on the FB sites of [BiCiCoHartford](https://www.facebook.com/BiCiCoHartford/) or [Transport Hartford](https://www.facebook.com/groups/491115301016844/) or [Breakfast Lunch & Dinner](https://www.facebook.com/breakfastxlunchxdinner/). Or see [this event announcement](https://www.facebook.com/events/1921841008042291) for the next ride on Sunday June 12th at 3pm, starting at the parking lot on 1429 Park Street in Hartford.

Also, the Bike West Hartford group has announced a series of [&#8220;Wheels on Wednesdays&#8221; rides](http://www.bikewesthartford.org/info), beginning on June 8th at 6:30pm in the parking lot behind West Hartford Town Hall, 50 South Main Street. These also are non-competitive friendly rides of about 10 miles or more, with groups for varying paces. The first ride will feature the West Hartford Reservoir. The organizers require you to wear a helmet and sign a liability form. This summer these rides are scheduled for alternate Wednesday evenings: June 8, June 22, July 6, July 20, Aug 3, Aug 17th.
