Last weekend I biked on a new section of the East Coast Greenway on the west side of Willimantic, Connecticut. Thanks to a new bridge that crosses the gap where the Hop River flows into the Willimantic River, cyclists can enjoy an additional half-mile of bike trail, away from traffic on CT Route 66. The new route is marked with ECG signage, but currently does not appear on the [ECG digital map](https://map.greenway.org/?loc=16,41.71982,-72.24912). So this post includes a map of the additional section (shown in red below), with a link to the [downloadable GPX file](jackdougherty.github.io/bikemapcode/routes/ecg-willimantic-new.gpx) for ECG mapmakers, and offers some tips to riders.

If you're heading WEST from Willimantic to Andover, here's the new route:

- follow ECG signs past the railroad museum, along the paved river trail
- the paved path continues past a new wooden kiosk near Mackey's store
- follow the paved path on the new bridge across the Hop River
- the route continues to Flanders Road, but the pavement does not

If you're heading EAST from Andover to Willimantic, you need to watch for the route signs:
- when the Hop River Trail ends, turn left onto Kings Road
- turn right onto Flanders Road
- on the left side of Flanders Road, look for an ECG marker to the non-paved trail
- follow the non-paved trail across the new bridge onto the paved trail into Willimantic

Some observations about current trail conditions, which I hope will be improved:

{% include figure image_path="images/2019/2019-09-29-willimantic-sand.jpg" caption="Further west, the current trail has a few patches of deep sand." %}

{% include figure image_path="images/2019/2019-09-29-willimantic-needs-sign.jpg" caption="Still further west, the current trail forks in three directions, and needs a sign to point the correct path: the middle." %}

The Town of Windham has scheduled a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the new bridge on Saturday October 12th, 2019 at 11am at wooden kiosk next to Mackey's. Congratulation to all who continue to make biking safer in Connecticut.
