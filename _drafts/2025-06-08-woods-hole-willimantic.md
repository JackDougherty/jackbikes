Back was when I was younger, I had this notion in my head about biking *twice* my age in miles to celebrate my birthday. So when I turned 50 years old a decade ago, I pushed myself to bike 100 miles from Hartford CT to Providence RI. Cyclists call this 100-mile trip a *century* ride, and while the British measure is totally arbitrary, pedaling that distance helped persuade me that I wasn't really getting that much older. At least I *felt* younger, for a little while longer.

But when I reached my early 50s, I had to drop the whole *double-your-age* biking distance goal, because my body wasn't up to going farther. Instead, I was happy to maintain my annual 100-mile summer bike pilgrimage from Hartford to Providence, figuring that if I could still do a *century* ride, that would delay the century-age mark. For example, on my [55th birthday during the pandemic](/2020-bakery-long-way/), I biked 100 miles to Providence solely to buy almond chocolate croissants at Seven Stars Bakery, stayed overnight in an inexpensive room, and biked 100 miles back the next day. While I can still taste those delicious pastries, my century-length rides are fading further away in my rear-view mirror.

While completing my 60th orbit around the sun this summer, I've spent some time pondering the question: *why am I biking?* Fortunately there's plenty of time for reflection while pedaling on long bike trips. It's time to redefine my goals, and start embracing my age rather than avoiding it. Let's face reality: [I'm ten pounds heavier now than I was a decade ago](/2014-northwest-numbers/). My winter weight gain has become harder to sweat away every biking season. Also, I had to make some physical and mental adjustments after my right eye stopped working due to an optic nerve stroke in early 2022. While my optometrist and the Department of Motor Vehicles decided that I could no longer drive a 4,000-pound car at 60 miles per hour, they're perfectly fine with a 185-pound guy pedaling at his average speed of 13 miles per hour. To adjust, I traded in my more aerodynamic dropdown handlebar bike for an upright handlebar bike that

I need to face the reality that I'm ten pounds heavier than I was a decade ago, and my winter weight gain is becoming harder to sweat away every spring. Also, when my right eye stopped working due to an optic nerve stroke in 2022, I was able to continue biking but had to make some adjustments. Instead of riding my more aerodynamic and lightweight dropdown handlebar bike, I now pedal an upright handlebar bike that gives me a better view of the roadway, but with additional wind resistance. Also, my upright Priority 600 bike includes a front-wheel dynamo that generates electrical front and rear lights to make me more visible to drivers, but at a slight cost to biking-energy efficiency. When I switched bikes, I consciously traded more safety for slightly lower speed.

Rather than chasing distances longer than a century, I find myself dreaming up cycling adventures that help me stay connected with old friends.

So as I approach the sixty-year-old mark this summer, why am I still biking? (Fortunately there's lots of time to ponder these questions while on long trips behind the handlebars.) Instead of chasing





As I approach my 60th orbit around the sun, I’m trying to embrace my aging body, rather than avoid it, and rethink why I’m pedaling. What am I doing with the years I was given? Bakeries will always be part of the equation. But now it seems more meaningful if I’m pedaling to a pastry shop to pick up something yummy to share with an old friend who I’m visiting. Retaining those relationships are more often the goal nowadays, since one cannot create “old friends”.
