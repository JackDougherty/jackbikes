When biking around the Hartford region in Connecticut, I count on these organizations to connect me with other people who also desire to make cycling easier and safer for all.

  * [BiCi Co.](http://bicico.org/) (Spanish abbreviation for Bicicletas y Comunidad), a community bike shop in Hartford. See also on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/BiCiCoHartford/). Both BiCi Co. and [Transport Hartford](http://transporthartford.org/)Â  are projects of the [Center for Latino Progress](http://www.ctprf.org/).
  * [BikeWalkCT](http://www.bikewalkct.org/), a member-supported non-profit advocate for biking and walking in Connecticut. See also on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/bikewalkct?fref=ts).
  * [Bike West Hartford](http://www.bikewesthartford.org/), a non-profit organization that sponsors Center Streets. See also on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/bikewesthartford/).
