We built a minivan camper that slides into 2016 Toyota Sienna to give us more flexibility for long weekends and bike touring during the pandemic. It includes a small kitchen and refrigerator, a portable power station with a solar panel, and a couch that converts into a full-size bed. Watch our first-stage build video from January 2021 on YouTube:
