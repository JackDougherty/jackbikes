We built a minivan camper that slides into 2016 Toyota Sienna to give us more flexibility for long weekends and bike touring during the pandemic. It includes a small kitchen and refrigerator, a portable power station with a solar panel, and a couch that converts into a full-size bed. Watch our [first-stage build YouTube video from January 2021](https://youtu.be/_hmhEr1s7F0):

## Ventilation

Our next project is to add ventilation, and I'm just beginning to research different approaches.

- [passive window vents](https://youtu.be/ixEpp4hoofU)
- [window screens with DC-powered fans](https://expeditionportal.com/forum/threads/window-insert-for-12vdc-fan-ventilation.161467/page-2)
- [van room vent with DC-powered fan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXvb9SAEv5M)
- and Bruce Parks gets a special mention for his [custom screens](https://youtu.be/XaPqxGuifpA) and [electric vent intake system](https://youtu.be/oO2-2EKtJLc?t=203)

Suggestions welcome!
