Traveling by bike -- both locally and long-distance touring -- makes me feel more connected with people and places than being trapped inside a moving metal box. See [all posts](#all-posts) listed below, or explore by [categories](/categories), including [tours with maps](/categories/#tours-with-maps) and how we built our [minivan camper](/minivan-camper) that sleeps two and carries our tandem bike! For questions, [contact me by email](mailto:jackdrty@gmail.com).

Explore [full-size interactive maps of my US & Canadian bike tours](https://jackdougherty.github.io/bikemapcode/index.html). Click colored routes to read posts, and click upper-right Photos box to view thumbnail images on maps. View [all my bike tour photos on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/56513965@N06/albums).
