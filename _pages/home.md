Touring by bike is my favorite way to explore, because the experience is richer than by foot or by car. Read my [Tours with Maps posts](https://jackbikes.org/categories/#tours-with-maps) or click around the [interactive map](https://jackdougherty.github.io/bikemapcode/index.html) below. See also bike touring resources from [Adventure Cycling](https://www.adventurecycling.org), [East Coast Greenway](http://www.greenway.org/), [Rails-to-Trails Conservancy](http://www.railstotrails.org/), and [Warmshowers.org](http://warmshowers.org).

Also read my biking [Around Hartford CT posts](https://jackbikes.org/categories/#around-hartford-ct), and learn about local organizations that advocate to make cycling easier and safer for all, such as the [BiCi Co.](http://bicico.org/) community bike shop, [Transport Hartford](http://transporthartford.org/), [BikeWalkCT](http://www.bikewalkct.org/), and [Bike West Hartford](http://bikewesthartford.org/).
