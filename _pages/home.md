Touring by bike is my favorite way to explore, because the experience is richer than by foot or by car. Read my [Bike Tours with Maps posts](https://jackbikes.org/categories/#bike-tours-with-maps) or click around the [interactive map](https://jackdougherty.github.io/bikemapcode/index.html) below. See also bike touring resources from [Adventure Cycling](https://www.adventurecycling.org), [East Coast Greenway](http://www.greenway.org/), [Rails-to-Trails Conservancy](http://www.railstotrails.org/), and [Warmshowers.org](http://warmshowers.org).
