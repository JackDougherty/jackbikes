Touring by bike helps me to see and experience more of the world than riding in a car. Read my [tours with maps posts](https://jackbikes.org/categories/#tours-with-maps). Open the [full-size interactive map of my US-Canadian tours](https://jackdougherty.github.io/bikemapcode/index.html), select routes to read posts, click the box to view thumbnail photos on the map, or view [my tour photos on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/56513965@N06/albums).
